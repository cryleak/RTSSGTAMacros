# RTSSGTAMacros
Uses RivaTuner Statistics Server Shared Memory to try to make GTA Online Macros as fast as possible by syncing them to your framerate.

It is highly recommended to set an FPS cap of some kind in RTSS to attempt to improve the stability of your frametimes; it may not work properly otherwise, especially on Enhanced due to the incredibly poor frametime consistency on Enhanced.

This is a proof of concept: I don't know how viable this actually is to use in gameplay but I am curious to find out; they should work on both the Legacy and Enhanced version of GTA V.


Please do play around with the InputHandler delays here to find optimal delay settings for latency. You can even make them negative, if you want to, for some reason.

You must have RTSS enabled for GTA V for these to work at all, and configured like so.

(Framerate limit and OSD is personal preference)

You must also turn off "Disable Windows Key" in the Rockstar Games Launcher before launching GTA.
